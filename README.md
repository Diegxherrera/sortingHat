# Sorting Hat Game

Have you ever wondered which Hogwarts house you belong to? Now, with the "Harry Potter Sorting Hat Simulator"
project, you can experience the magic of the Sorting Hat from J.K. Rowling's wizarding world right on your computer.

This open-source Java project is designed to replicate the Sorting Hat's decision-making process. Users will be asked
a series of questions, and based on their responses, the Sorting Hat will assign them to one of the four iconic
Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin.
